## Goal

By 2020 general election, completely change the way news is consumed on the web.

Sophisticated, interactive visualizations of data, and insightful analysis.
Focus on politics and business: make people better informed at the ballot box and the board room.

---

## Overall Strategy

1. Relaunch Eaten by Monsters music blog.
2. Visually impressive Rugby World Cup infographics website.
3. Upward trajectory. [exit/grow/kill]
4. Expand into business and politics.
5. National/international news brand.

## Unfair Advantage

Intersection of technology and editorial. A proper approach needs a "digital native" with skills in development, design, and strategic thinking. This specific breed of generalist is hard to find, let alone one with an interest in editorial content.

## Manifesto

### Schedule

For a service that is not just "on the web" but "of the web", there are requirements and benefits aplenty.

"Issues" and "Editions" no longer make sense. There is nothing to be gained from tyeing content to a specific time. An accessible and *useful* archive is something a digital service can master much more efficiently than one tied to regular updates (repetition of content rather than continual updating of one piece of content).


### Adds

Monetization is important, and advertising revenue is most likely going to be the primary source of income. One gains nothing from being snooty about adverts, but they must *never* compromise the reading experience. Local news sites are plagued by obtrusive, invasive, irritating ads. Many respectable blogs maximize income by sacrificing design purity.

Ads must fit within the site's priorities (responsive, performant, content-first)

Ads must be relevant/targeted.

### Agregated Content

No unrelated aggregated content. (BuzzFeed links, spam, click-bait, etc.). They may drive *numbers* but actively sour the experience for the target demographic (people with brains).

## Phases

### Phase 1

Relaunch Eaten by Monsters music blog.

* strong editorial design
* easily browse-able archive
* information in context
    - up: wider, broader context. Position in the world. Big themes, grand ideas, much wow.
    - down: tighter, more focused context. More detail, more specific.
* Reading experience comes before all else

###Â Phase 2

Visually impressive Rugby World Cup infographics website.

* working with complex data-sets
* simple illustrations of complex ideas
* show relationships others have missed
* generate awareness
    - rugby fans on twitter
    - friends and relations
    - tech nerds
    - design geeks
* prove hypothesis : the web can present data and news in a way no other medium can manage

### Phase 3

Upward trajectory.

#### Potential "exits" from plan:

* Aqui-hire?
* Traditional hire?
* Investment:
    - runway
    - business model
    - build team
    - real journalism

#### Otherwise:

* Expand coverage for 6 Nations
* Alternative deadines:
    - Rio Olympics
    - Wimbledon
    - Ashes (Wisden data-set integration/partnership)

### Phase 4

Expand into other fields
    - business
    - politics

Potential at this point to partner/get-hired-by old-media institution looking to adapt and survive.
* local news
* national, even?

### Phase 5

National/international news brand. Trusted source; part of the collective discussion. Victory.

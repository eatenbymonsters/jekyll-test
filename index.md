If you like working with HTML `<audio>` and the Web Audio API, checkout [SFAP.js](/audioDemo) and my [keyboard project](/keyboard). SFAP.js is an open-source tool that allows us to style an audio player with CSS. My keyboard project is a fully-functional synthesizer built using JS, HTML and CSS.
    
And if you like CSS callisthenics, have a look at my [CSS tape player](/cassette-script). Not "useful" if the slightest, but a fun bit of illustration built in the browser. Illustrator and Photoshop are for chumps! (unless, of course, you're building super-performant resolution agnostic [inline SVG icons](/inline-svg-icons)...)

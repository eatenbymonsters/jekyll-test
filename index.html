    <h1>I'm a web designer and developer based in Cornwall, UK.</h1>
    <h3 class="big-drop-cap">Designing for the web is about more than painting pretty pictures of websites. You have to get down and dirty in the browser as soon as possible.</h3>
    
		<p>In this post-smartphone age we have to build sites that work on everything from watch-sized screens to touch devices the size of table-tops. The print ‘canvas’ is a myth in web-design; as designers we must embrace the dynamic ever-changing beauty of the web.</p>

		<p>So how do we do it? By experimenting, by testing, by iterating. No one ever created a beautifully elegant checkout submission process by using static images, and no one did it in one abstract brainstorming session.</p>

		<p>I'm a UX designer and developer at <a href="http://digitalwebmedia.co.uk">DWM</a>, where I currently spend most of my time re-designing client-onboarding processes and obsessing about whether or not to get a Standing Desk (for the crazy-start-up kudos).</p>

    <p>Browse my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> to see some (not so recent) examples of my work, and read more of my thoughts on designing for the web on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. Say hi (and tell me how wrong you think I am, maybe?) by emailing me at <a href="mailto:me@thomashazledine.com">me@thomashazledine.com</a> or catch me on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/thomashazledine">@thomashazledine</a>; I'm always happy to answer any questions or engage in spirited debate.</p>

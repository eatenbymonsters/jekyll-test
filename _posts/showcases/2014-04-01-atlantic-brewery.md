This project was a complete rebuild of the Atlantic Brewery website; the kind of tabula-rasa that designers like me dream of. Setting up the complex information architecture for the  myriad of product options was a real challenge, and the end result is a comprehensive and robust e-commerce site.

The new Atlantic website is fully resonsive; it delivers the full experience to devices of all sizes and resolutions, and takes into account the subtle differences in interaction that touch-enabled devices bring to the party.

<title>Simple Is Hard</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;“Simplify, simplfy!” we’re often told. Your service isn’t appealing to your customers? The answer’s simple: simplify! Your song isn’t connecting with your fanbase? Simplify! You aren’t shifting as many units as Apple? Simplify! It’s an easy mantra to mock, and even easier to swallow hook, line, and sinker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need to do is distinguish between ‘simple’ and ‘simplistic’. It’s fairly obvious that content suffers when overrun by crowded, cluttered, un-navigable interfaces. If what you’re saying has value, you don’t need the kitchen sink to help you say it. But what do you need? And how much can you afford to throw out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Only keep what you need.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deleting everything that you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; need only works when you know for sure what you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; need. It’s tempting to think of simplifying a design as merely stripping away layers of visual ornamentation, but true simplicity comes more from the &lt;em&gt;user experience&lt;/em&gt; than the look of the thing. Hiding an unsightly menu behind a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/10/08/the-semantic-responsive-design-navicon/&quot;&gt;hamburger icon&lt;/a&gt; is an easy way to de-clutter an app’s interface, for example, but does that count as simplification? All that achieves is forcing the user to make an extra click when they want to navigate somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearing away useless clutter is generally a good tactic, but there’s a distinct difference between &lt;em&gt;simplifying&lt;/em&gt; a product and merely making it’s function more obtuse. Is one button with five functions really better than five buttons that each do one task? Is an aesthetically-pure minimalist interface really ideal if you then need to teach every new user how it works?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with any task worth doing, there are many levels of nuance to simplification. It takes judgement; an assessment of what functions are important to your product, your app, your idea. Strip away anything extraneous and put anything the user needs front-and-centre, but don’t confuse the two or you’ll live to regret it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This website is all about words.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page you’re reading now went through many iterations before settling on the look you see today. Early drafts were swamped with full-page background images and clever CSS3 animation effects, but no matter how fancy I got with the coding these early designs never felt quite right. Then I stumbled upon &lt;a href=&quot;http://justinjackson.ca/words.html&quot;&gt;Justin Jackson’s inspired ‘This Is A Web Page’ anticle&lt;/a&gt; and was reminded that what was important for this site was the words themselves. It goes deeper than that, even: what’s important to this site is the &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt;. It could be read aloud by a screen-reader, translated into sign-language, even transmitted telepathically for all I care. As long as the message can be absorbed, this page will have done it’s job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I was doing with my early designs was trying to build a ‘great website’, when what I should really have been focusing on was building a great content delivery system. It seems video is the &lt;em&gt;de rigueur&lt;/em&gt; medium for getting messages across quickly, and for a while I did toy with the idea of making this page into a vlog, but ultimately words are purer. Video is harder to create than written content, and would skew the message with all the baggage brought along by seeing my face (beautiful) or hearing my accent (perfectly inflected Queen’s English). With the written word I have more chance of capturing the ‘white heat of inspiration’ and of being able to communicate my thoughts clearly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Why use any styling at all?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why not go all-out and strip out all the styling from this page completely? Properly written semantic HTML is nothing &lt;em&gt;but&lt;/em&gt; content, so surely stripping away everything else would be the most efficient way to get the message across? Well, quite frankly, the default styling applied by web browsers is &lt;em&gt;ugly&lt;/em&gt;, and that’s not as shallow a complaint as you might think. Concepts like line-height, line-length, leading &amp;amp; kerning each have a huge impact on the readability of text. To trust all those to the random whims of a browser is madness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s often said that &lt;a href=&quot;http://alistapart.com/article/on-web-typography#section3&quot;&gt;we read best what we read most&lt;/a&gt;, and my friends and I read &lt;em&gt;books&lt;/em&gt;. Books are fantastically efficient, and the best ones are things of beauty that wrap their content in a nourishing blanket of aesthetic proportions and finely-wrought typefaces. Given how many books I own solely on the topic of type design and typography, I can’t stand idly by and leave my content at the mercy of the ‘web-safe’ default fonts. I have to believe that good typography and good design makes the reading experience better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Simple doesn’t have to be ugly.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems obvious, but websites &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; have a lot to learn from books. Just because we &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; swamp everything in technical wizardry doesn’t mean we &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt;, but it equally doesn’t mean we should abandon design altogether. ‘Simple’ doesn’t (and &lt;em&gt;shouldn’t&lt;/em&gt;) mean ‘ugly’, and the simple act of thinking about line-lengths and visual hierarchies can turn an indigestible splurge of HTML into something readable, and in the right hands even something beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the right balance between visual simplicity, simplicity of interaction and a pleasing aesthetic is a real challenge, and I’ll be the first to admit I’ve still a long way to go. But at least now I’m pointing in the right direction; simple is important, simple is necessary, and simple is really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>A Bullet-Journal workflow</title>
<description>&lt;p&gt;Making task lists can be fantastically useful, but it’s all too easy to loose them. My paper lists get buried under reams of doodles and random notes, or lost in the depths of a full notebook that simply has &lt;em&gt;too much in it&lt;/em&gt;. Even digital lists get lost, and I find I lack the discipline to open a mammoth text file every morning. Paper is much better for immediate reference, even if it is easy to miss-place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Productivity Hacking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quest for elegant ‘productivity hacks’ is both fantastically useful and fantastically counter-productive. You can waste days reading about how not to waste your time. Finally, however, it seems that all the hours I’ve spent reading about productivity-hacks weren’t wasted after all; my current system finds me being &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; efficient and productive than I’ve ever been before. And at the hub of my new-found momentum lies my Bullet Journal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bullet Journal Concept&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devised by inspired Brooklynite &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rydercarroll.com/&quot;&gt;Ryder Carrol&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; is little more than a seemingly-simple method of writing out a ‘to-do’ list using a pen and a notebook. I’ve experimented with similar list-hierarchies in the past, with mixed results, and while this new one is elegant, it’s not exactly revolutionary. But there’s one aspect of the Bullet Journal system that I’ve found to be a real revelation: the way the list rolls-over from day-to-day and month-to-month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/journal01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Bullet Journal hanging in its place&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What first drew me to the Bullet Journal was the systematized nature of its bullet-point organization, but what’s &lt;em&gt;kept&lt;/em&gt; me using it is the way it stays relevant.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Simplicity.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love simplicity, and the system itself is fairly straightforward – each list item is marked with either a square, circle or mid-dot. The square boxes denote tasks, circles events, and dots are standard notes (things to remember, but not explicitly actionable). At the start of every month I draw up a list of long-term goals, and then each morning I set out my daily tasks. I number the pages as I go, and keep an index at the front of the notebook. This makes assessing progress on long-term goals a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There’s only ever one active list.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of every day I write out a new daily list. Any items unchecked from the day before are either struck-through (which denotes they’ve become irrelevant) or marked with an arrow and copied into the new daily list. This way you never have to refer back to old lists hidden in the depths of the notebook, and it’s painfully obvious when a task is being continually put-off (which forces you to act: either do it or mark it as irrelevant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;There’s still long-term structure.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there’s only the one active list for you to deal with at any one time, the monthly lists are useful for reference, making it harder for day-to-day tasks to swamp your ‘big picture’ aims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It’s flexible.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bullet Journal system is loose enough that it never gets in the way of my day-to-day workflow. If i need a date-agnostic list on a specific topic, I just make it and add the page number to the index. Little additions like this make the whole process expandable and fairly all-encompassing, and the day-to-day running of the list is never disturbed by all these additions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;It’s really easy.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the journal up to date sounds like rather an onerous task, what with all the indexing, page-numbering, and three-tiered bullet system. In reality, keeping on top of all my lists is no hassle at all. Updating the list takes about 10 minutes every morning, and up to half-an-hour on the first day of every month (as I update my calendar, and re-set my long-term goals).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/journal02.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;My Bullet Journal&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The journal isn’t &lt;em&gt;solely&lt;/em&gt; responsible for my productivity upswing, but it’s definitely helped.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By way of a disclaimer, making the switch to a Bullet Journal workflow wasn’t the only change I’ve made recently. A few months ago I quit my day-job and struck out on my own; an intrepid freelancer &lt;em&gt;cum&lt;/em&gt; entrepreneur bound for riches and glory! So now that any-and-all money that I make is directly proportional to how much work I do, it’ll come as no surprise that I’m working harder and longer than ever before (and would be with or without the Bullet Journal).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bulletjournal.com/&quot;&gt;Bullet Journal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; undeniably helped my workflow. My days now have structure, and (most importantly) I’m now much less likely to overlook an important task.&lt;/p&gt;

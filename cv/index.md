{:.intro#intro}
I am a front-end developer and UX/UI designer currently working for DWM, a web agency based in Newquay.

I am inspired by the work coming out of organizations like GDS and The Guardian, and also by the processes behind the work. The idea of using iteration and "marginal improvements" to solve design problems feels like a natural approach. I am eager to join a team that is product-led.

> I try to build things that are "of the web" not just "on the web".

{:#skills}
## Current Responsibilities and Interests

### 1. Front-end Templating

I spend most of my working-day with SCSS and javascript. I try to be judicial with my inclusion of jQuery, and wherever possible stick to raw JS.

* “View” development for MVC projects (Laravel / Vue.js / etc.)
* Interaction with JSON APIs (most recently the Wordpress REST API).
* Animations and iconsets: mobile menus, scrollers and sliders, etc.
* Custom CSS for form elements: datepickers, selects and checkboxes.
* Automated workflow: Gulp.js / GIT deployment / etc.

### 2. Performance

Performance budgets are important, and "speed" should be a consideration for any web project. My blog scores 97/100 on Google’s PageSpeed Insights tester.

* Static HTML compiled by Jekyll.
* Inline “above the fold” CSS in the first 14.5kb.
* Asynchronous loading of javascript and main css.
* Concatenation and minification of all resources.
* Inline SVG icon set.

### 3. HTML Audio

My background is in music, so I have always been interested in audio on the web. I have built an open-source javascript tool for styling audio players with CSS ([github.com/tomhazledine/stylefreeaudio](//github.com/tomhazledine/stylefreeaudio)) and have used the Web Audio API to build a working synthesizer ([tomhazledine.com/keyboard](//tomhazledine.com/keyboard)).

### 4. CSS Illustration

I make CSS illustrations partly to keep my SCSS skills honed, but mostly for fun. Several of my creations have been featured on the front-page of [CodePen](//codepen.io/tomhazledine/).

### 5. Typography, Type Design, and Lettering

My experiments with type design have given me a fantastic insight into the world of typography and typesetting. Buying, restoring, and operating a hand-cranked letterpress machine has given me a real-world understanding of typographical concepts that can be abstract or obtuse in digital form.

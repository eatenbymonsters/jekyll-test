    <h2><a href="http://tombuildswebsites.com">Tom Builds Websites</a></h2>

    <p>When I&#8217;m not sipping fine scotch and basking in the glory of my vinyl collection, I make websites. It&#8217;s less fun than making music, but more fun than anything else people are prepared to pay me for. I specialize in building bespoke, tasteful sites for SMEs and any artistic endeavour that wants to take itself seriously and look cool in the process. I guess my main strength is my CSS wizadry (all pre-processed SASS/Compass, naturally), but I&#8217;m also happy working with PHP, Javascript/JQuery, Ruby, Liquid, YAML, and I spend far more time than is good for me mucking about in the command line (and occasionally <em>not</em> making catastrophic mistakes, too!). I do almost all my writing in Markdown now – because it&#8217;s awesome – and my whole workflow is GIT-versioned-controlled up to my eyeballs.</p>

    <h2><a href="http://eatenbymonsters.com">Eaten by Monsters: The Music Blog</a></h2>
    
    <p>Founded in 2008 with nothing but a free wordpress.com account and keg-load of hustle, Eaten by Monsters has grown into an award-winning, taste-making, discourse-shaping powerhouse (albeit in a very specific niche). Writing EbM has opened the door to a host of opportunities; writing for Tom Robinson&#8217;s <a href="http://freshonthenet.co.uk/how-to-reach-music-blogs/">Fresh On The Net</a> blog, learning all about web publishing the hard way, and (most importantly) getting me on the press-lists for all my favourite record labels. Free music FTW!</p>

    <h2><a href="http://eatenbymonste.rs">Eaten by Monsters: The Band</a></h2>
    
    <p>Working on the principle that good names are hard to come by, my band was also called Eaten by Monsters. I say <em>was</em> because it&#8217;s been a long time since we released anything. <em>Scaring the Pets</em> was our only ‘proper’ record, and was met with positive attention from critics and podcasters (getting featured on BBC 6 Music and The Waiting Room, among others, and earning a raft of good reviews from my music-blogging peers) but never took off the way I&#8217;d hoped it would (I have yet to play a sold-out five-night residency at Wembley Arena, for instance). It did give me the excuse to work with a vast array of talented musicians in an impressive selection of top-spec&#8217;ed recording studios, and led to some very fun performances at most of London&#8217;s best small venues (the Camden Barfly and sadly-now-defunct Luminaire gigs being particular highlights).</p>

title: Torn between making a web app or a native one? When I want to get things done I make web apps.

Native apps are the ones you download to a device and run as a discrete application (hence the name). So-called web-apps accomplish similar tasks, but run in your browser. Whether a website actually counts as an app, however, is an altogether more contentious issue.

> The boundaries between web-apps and web-sites are blurry. But so are most things we try to define. Arguing about it is nothing more than a distraction.

As with so many tech-industry naming conventions, the difference between regular websites and web apps only matters when you're arguing for or against one or the other. Everyone else just gets on with making things. Whether you call it an "app" or a "site" has no impact at all on what your creation actually *does*.

Personally, I find I just *know* which is which. Most websites don't have that instinctive "app feel". E-commerce sites, for instance, generally have quite complex user-login areas that feel app-like but I'd most likely class those as websites.

The WordPress dashboard is so fully-featured that it could quite easily (and often does) power an app, and all the mechanics of posting new content have many of the characteristics of an app: you need to login, you're accomplishing user-centric tasks, you have your own personalised dashboard. I'd still class the vast majority of WordPress installs as *websites*.

Thankfully, though, the web-apps I concern myself with don't lie in that grey-area. I'm not saying there isn't an issue here, I'm just kicking it down the path. The fuzziness is someone-else's problem; I've got work to do.

## Why choose one over the other?

One of the main reasons native apps are so popular on iPads and iPhones is that the iOS browsing experience sucks balls. Want to switch back to a tab you were on seconds ago? Sorry, you're going to have to load the page again! Use a real browser on a real computer and the web wins hands-down every time.

Native apps can also tap into device features more directly than something that runs in a browser can. Want to access files, sync with the cloud, or authenticate using an external service? All much more straightforward (for the end user) in an app.

## Why not have both?

In most cases, an app will have a browser version and a native app version. This is a sign of a mature product: the users can do what they need to do wherever they feel most comfortable. Where the distinction comes into play is in the early stages of a new venture.

In the early days, resources are scarce and technical skills are usually limited to one or two languages or areas of expertise. In these cases, decisions need to be made, if only for the sake of expediency.

If anything, developing your minimum viable product for every platform available is a staggering waste of resources. Maintaining two (or more) separate codebases when you're still working on product/market fit will only slow you down.

## This is where a web app can really help you out.

The web just works. Sure, keeping you UX consistent across platforms can be a technical pain-in-the-arse when you're relying on cutting-edge features, but get it right and your app will run anywhere that can open a website. And that's pretty much every device out there.

As soon as you choose a native platform you're closing off your app to a whole slew of the market. Develop an iOS app, and now no-one on an Android device can use your product. Or anyone on a desktop, or anyone on Windows or Linux or whatever else they might be using.

Make your app as a website and it will run everywhere (if you've done it right).

## Updates
Easy to deploy updates.

## Foundations

Good foundation for porting to other platforms later if needed.

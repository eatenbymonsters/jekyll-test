# Thomas Hazledine

## Development directory for thomashazledine.com

This is where I will experiment with design ideas for my generic blog/portfolio site.
The style.css file is generated using Compass/SASS, and the relevant files are in the /sass/ directory, controled by the config.rb file.
The site itself is build using Jekyll, controlled by the _config.yml file.

    <h1>I'm a web designer and developer based in Cornwall, UK.</h1>
    <h3 class="big-drop-cap">I believe in building websites that are accessible. Accessible to all devices, platforms, and users. I build sites that deliver the same content and the same functionality whether the visitor is using a desktop, tablet, mobile phone, or screen reader.</h3>
    <p>I also believe in aesthetics; simplicity of form and function is valuable and important, but simple doesn't have to mean ugly. Careful use of typography, photography, and illustrationography can produce beautiful designs that are as easy and intuitive to use as they are visually pleasing. User Experience and graphic style go hand-in-hand.</p>
    <p>You can see some recent examples of my work in my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and read more of my thoughts on designing for the web on my <a href="/blog">blog</a>. To kickstart your project email me at <a href="mailto:me@thomashazledine.com">me@thomashazledine.com</a>; I'm always happy to answer any questions.</p>

# Getting Things Done

## How my Bullet Journal has revolutionized my workflow.

### It amazes me that the *Get Things Done* concept has sprung up an entire community, even an entire *industry*. In what seems like an immediately defeatist manner, there are books and books on GTD (as the cool kids call it) and any number of websites devoted to the topic. As someone who will happily obsess over the finest minutiae of something for ages before actually *doing* anything, this brand of procrastinating about avoiding procrastinating really hits me where I live.

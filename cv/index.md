{:.intro#intro}
I am a front-end developer and UX/UI designer, currently working for the DWM agency in Newquay, Cornwall. Frustrated with being seen as merely a "contractor", I feel the time has come to switch to more product-led workflow.

I'm becoming increasingly excited by the idea of iterative problem solving and marginal improvements. I hear about the exiting work coming out of organizations like GDS and The Guardian, and want some of that action for myself here in Cornwall.

There's only so many side-projects I can fit into evenings and weekends, and I want to experience that same sense of fulfillment in my day job too.

> I try to build things that are "of the web" not just "on the web".

{:#skills}
## Current Responsibilities and Interests

### 1. Designing and building all visual "interactions" for client sites.

Using pure CSS wherever possible, but often including Javascript for more complex functionality. Regularly use plenty of third-party libraries and plugins, but not always. I try to be judicial with my inclusion of jQuery: if a couple of extra lines of vanilla JS can replace an entire library, that's what I'll aim for.

* Animated icons and mobile menus.
* Scrollers and sliders.
* Datepickers and checkboxes.
* Accordions and dropdowns.

### 2. Performance

Having been lumbered with legacy code and poorly-spec'd projects far too often, I'm now a firm believer in performance budgets and baking-in speed considerations from the very beginning of a project.

My current personal site [tomhazledine.com](http://tomhazledine.com/) rates at 97/100 on Google's PageSpeed Insights tester (at time of writing).

* Static-site generator Jekyll is used for templating. It compiles complex HTML-includes and -partials into static files.
* Inline "critical path" CSS in the first 14.5kb of the site.
* Asynchronous loading of assets: both javascript *and* main css.
* Concatenation and minification of all scripts and resources. All JS libs/plugins and SCSS partials reduced to just two HTTP requests.
* Inline SVG icon set.
* The final steps to get the last 3%? Minify HTML and leverage browser caching on external fonts (which is out of my control as long as I keep using Typekit to serve my fonts).

### 3. HTML Audio

With a background in music and audio technology, I've always been interested in the delivery of audio on the web. My most recent side project is [SFAP.js](http://tomhazledine.com/audioDemo/), an open-source tool for styling audio players with CSS.

I've also experimented with the Web Audio API to build a fully-functioning synthesizer using HTML, CSS and javascript: [tomhazledine.com/keyboard](http://tomhazledine.com/keyboard/).

### 4. CSS Illustration

I like making CSS Illustrations. Partly to keep my CSS skills honed, but mostly for fun. My CSS Cassette, Pong-style loader, and Bear have all been featured on the front-page of [CodePen](http://codepen.io/tomhazledine/).

### 5. Typography, Type Design, and Lettering

Type design is long-time hobby of mine. I've yet to make a decent typeface all of my own, but my experiments have given me a fantastic insight into the world of typography and typesetting.

A few years ago I bought and restored an old hand-cranked letterpress machine. Setting type by hand has given me an intimate physical understanding of design concepts like 'measure' and 'leading' and 'ems' and 'ens'.

## Experience

### Lead UX Designer and Front-End Developer
* DWM
* 2014–

Specialist in web-specific responsive-first design: user experience, content architecture, atomic and object-oriented design and development. Trying my best to stop people creating *paintings* of websites and focus instead on actually designing *functional* websites.

### Web Designer / Developer
* Freelance
* 2013–2014

Built websites for various clients, including Atlantic Brewery; a Newquay-based independent brewery. Also undertook graphic design projects for Radio Exe and The Cornwall Brewers' Alliance.

### Audio Editor
* Plain Text Ltd.
* 2004–2007

Solely responsible for editing raw interview recordings into broadcast-quality podcasts and radio features for clients such as Hewlett Packard, Unilever and Exeter FM. Required a high level of fluency with DAW software, particularly Logic Studio.


### Writer/Designer/Developer
* eatenbymonsters.com
* 2008–2014

My music blog (a mixture of reviews and music industry comment) has now attracted over 100,000 unique visitors. I am on the press mailing lists for several record labels and receive a high volume of review submissions from unsigned bands. Through running the site, I have made numerous contacts with other bloggers, press agencies, and independent labels, and with a host of up-coming artists; lending me a certain legitimacy when I claim to be at the very coalface of new music in England.

### Session Musician
* Freelance
* 2006-Present

Provided guitar for a number of projects over the years, including sessions at the EMI studios at the Roundhouse in Camden, various corporate functions and gallery openings, and on one occasion even playing in front of Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page.

{:#qualifications}
## Qualifications

### MA in Music from Goldsmiths University, London

* 2010 – 2011

A fiercely academic programme focused on the 20th century avant-garde. My time at Goldsmiths instructed me in rigorous research practices and taught me to critically evaluate a wide range of complex concepts, theories, and modes of thought.

### BMus (Hons) [2.1] in Commercial Music from the University of Westminster

* 2006 – 2009

Here I developed my more serious academic faculties and vastly improved my musical ability (both as a performer and producer). Crucially, it was here that I first began to seriously engage with making things for the web: to support various uni-based projects I started my first blog and coded my first solo websites. Baby-steps, to be sure, but from here onwards I have had an incrementally-expanding day-to-day interaction with the concepts and languages of the web.

### BTEC National Diploma, Music Performance [Distinction] from Truro College

* 2004 – 2006
* Also attained Music Theory, Grade 5 [Distinction].

Founded an independent record label, and designed our website. Convinced a much more technical friend to build it for us, with me peering over his shoulder every step of the way. "Together", we hand-rolled our own PHP content management system and graphical backend interface.

### 3 A-Levels from Truro School

* 2002 – 2004
* Art [B]
* Geology [B]
* Theatre Studies [B]

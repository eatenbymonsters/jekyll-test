What is IoT?

IoT is happening now.

Consumer "Internet of Shit".
Industrial Internet of Maintenance.

Examples:
* Flight recorders
* Trains
* Wind Turbines
* Offices
* Electricity Grid
* Stadium Bathrooms
* Pirelli Truck Tires

Platforms are already in place.
    - enterprise networks
    - The Things Network

Hardware is not the differentiator; design firms will be essential.

It is small-scale projects that will shape the industry.

Design Challenges

Call to Action

## Examples

* Flight recorders:
    - 1kb, 30 params, 3 snapshots/flight
    - 500Gb, 5k params, 1 snapshot/second
    - wash the engines, save $7m pa.
* Trains:
    - over a mile long
    - use gravity to get over hills
    - every extra mph in capacity = $200k saving.
* Wind Turbines:
    - trouble with turbulence
    - dynamic demand management
    - can sell at any price
    - Tesla and batteries.
* Offices:
    - Learning about a building’s ‘health’:
        - lighting-levels
        - environmental factors
        - footfall, etc.
    - Gives you insight into:
        - employee absenteeism
        - efficiency of your workforce, etc.
    - Average cost of one desk in London is £12k p.a. Small percentage increases in efficiency can reap big rewards.
* Electricity Grid:
    - only learn about outages when customers phone up to complain.
    - They then need a truck-roll (apparently the biz-speak for “sending a truck”) to diagnose the problem.
    - Then a second truck-roll with the specialist equipment to deal with the issue.
    - The grid is provisioned for ‘hits’ – the two weeks of the year with peak-demand dictate the infrastructure for the whole system.
* Stadium Bathrooms:
    - allow for efficient management of supply (water, soap, loo-roll etc.) to deal with massive demand in short time-windows.
* Pirelli Truck Tires:
    - Measure speed, heat, pressure, etc.
    - Can be replaced before they fail.
    - The company has changed to a new business model: leasing the tires rather than selling them.

## Design Challenges:

* We don’t expect “things” to behave like the internet. Light bulbs shouldn’t “buffer”.
* Interfaces (if they are honest) should introduce the concept of failure to users. Don’t fake success when a user clicks a button in a low-connectivity area: show in interstitial “loading” state wherever possible.
* You often have to choose between fuzzy-and-current or accurate-but-old. A cat-tracker can either say “Mrs. Tibbles was at this exact location 3 hours ago” or “Mrs. Tibbles is somewhere within this range right now”.
* Linking physical and digital interfaces takes special thought. A traditional dimmer-switch always knows it’s ‘state’, where as a remotely-controlled version has to account for the fact that the ‘state’ of the bulb might have changed since it last checked.

IoT = machines talking to machines and doing things.
M2M has been around for years [automatic doors]. What has changed is the ubiquity of connectivity.

"IoT" has been gaining popularity over the last few years.

IoT has reached the tipping point where *disaggregation* and *componentisation* can trigger the "hockey stick" of innovation everyone is looking for.

The standards and protocols will be set by short-term projects. It's much easier to innovate with things that won't kill people. Self-driving cars and med.-tech have long runways, big budgets, and require changes in regulatory structures.

Standards and protocols will be set by short-term projects: the Internet of Toys.

## Consumer IoT

"Internet Fridge" boondoggle

* Health
* wearables
* white-goods
* toys
* ambient intimacy

CES in Vegas last week. 100's of "smart" devices

## Industrial IoT

IoT at scale means predictive maintenance (and demand management).

$447bn spent anually on maintenance globally (about a 10th of total spending).



* cheap connectivity
* cheap computing power
* cheap big-data processing

The conference was pretty evenly divided into small-scale cutesy projects for the home, and big-picture change-the-world-in-the-most-boring-way-possible enterprise-scale undertakings.

Lots of people there (sponsors, speakers and attendees) were from *infrastructure* companies: people who make platforms.

IoT is like the World Wide Web 20 years ago, or even the ARPANET 30 years ago. The "killer application" hasn't been conceived yet. If a company wasn't in "New Media" they didn't see the point in getting a website.

Back then it was design firms that led the charge. They had the technical awareness and design-savvy. It can be the same this time.

## Why a design firm?

The hardware is still hard to make, for sure. But the modularisation of components, and the easy access to the supply chain in Shenzhen, means anyone can buy and re-sell a fancy new bit of tech. What marks out the true winners is the software - the IP that's hard to reproduce.

This needs to be market-leading. It needs design intelligence and usability expertise.

It takes 5–10yrs to make an overnight success. To be an industry leader

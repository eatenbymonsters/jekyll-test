### It amazes me that the *Get Things Done* concept has sprung up an entire community, even an entire *industry*. In what seems like an immediately defeatist manner, there are books and books and books on GTD (as the cool kids call it) and any number of websites devoted to the topic. As someone who will happily obsess over the finest minutiae of something for ages before actually *doing* anything, this brand of procrastinating about avoiding procrastinating really hits me where I live.

Lately, though, it seems that all the hours I've spent reading about productivity-hacks weren't wasted after all; my current system finds me being *more* efficient and productive than I've ever been before. At the hub of my new-found Get Things Done momentum lies my Bullet Journal. Devised by the inspired Brooklynite [Ryder Carrol](http://www.rydercarroll.com/), the [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) is at its heart a seemingly-simple method of writing out a ‘to-do’ list using nothing more than a pen and a notebook.

## I don't think the journal is *solely* responsible for my productivity upswing.

By way of a disclaimer, making the switch to a Bullet Journal workflow wasn't the only change I've made recently. A few months ago I quit my day-job and struck out on my own; an intrepid freelancer *cum* entrepreneur bound for riches and glory! So now that any-and-all money that I make is directly proportional to how much work I do, it'll come as no surprise that I'm working harder and longer than ever before (and would be with or without the Bullet Journal).

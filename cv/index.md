{:.intro#intro}
I am the Senior Developer a Gendall Design, a design and development agency based in Falmouth, Cornwall. At Gendall I work alongside a team of developers and designers on a wide variety of web projects, with a general focus on "destination" clients (holiday booking agencies, tourist attractions, and the like).

I am inspired by the work coming out of organizations like GDS and The Guardian, and also by the processes behind the work. The idea of using iteration and "marginal improvements" to solve design problems feels like a natural approach, and as such I am eager to join a team that is product-led.

> I try to build things that are "of the web" not just "on the web".

{:#skills}
## Current Responsibilities and Interests

### 1. Frontend Templating

I spend most of my working-day with SCSS, javascript and PHP. I work hard to keep my development workflow as efficient as possible, and have invested a lot of time into mastering my tools. I take a pragmatic approach to the inclusion of jQuery (for so long the closest thing JS had to a "standard library"), but the evolution of the language means there are now often more efficient and modern options available.

* “View” development for MVC projects (Laravel / Vue.js / etc.)
* Interaction with JSON APIs (most recently the Wordpress REST API).
* Animations and iconsets: mobile menus, scrollers and sliders, etc.
* Custom CSS for form elements: datepickers, selects and checkboxes.
* Automated workflow: Gulp.js / GIT deployment / etc.

### 2. Performance

Performance budgets are important, and "speed" should be a consideration for any web project. Recent client work has placed a heavy emphasis on load-times, and we've become experts at optimising for speed even with feature-rich and image-heavy sites.

* Asynchronous loading of javascript and main css.
* Concatenation and minification of all resources.
* Inline SVG icon set.

### 3. HTML Audio

My background is in music, so I have always been interested in audio on the web. I have built an open-source javascript tool for styling audio players with CSS ([github.com/tomhazledine/stylefreeaudio](//github.com/tomhazledine/stylefreeaudio)) and have used the Web Audio API to build a working synthesizer ([tomhazledine.com/keyboard](//tomhazledine.com/keyboard)) and some more fun [tools for tone generation](//codepen.io/tomhazledine/pen/wWQOBN).

### 4. CSS Illustration

I make CSS illustrations partly to keep my SCSS skills honed, but mostly for fun. Several of my creations have been featured on the front-page of [CodePen](//codepen.io/tomhazledine/).

### 5. Typography, Type Design, and Lettering

My experiments with type design have given me a fantastic insight into the world of typography and typesetting. Buying, restoring, and operating a hand-cranked letterpress machine has given me a real-world understanding of typographical concepts that can be abstract or obtuse in digital form.

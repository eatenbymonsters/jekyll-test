# About Me

## I build websites for money and write about music for free.

I work as a freelance web-designer. I wouldn’t call myself a “full stack” developer, as the thought of having to dive into `C++` or `Node.js` brings me out in a cold sweat, but I know enough to shepherd a website from inception to deployment without any trouble. I’m not just a do-it-in-Photoshop-and-hand-it-off-to-a-developer ‘designer,’ is what I’m saying. (In fact, I hardly ever use Photoshop. Throw down a mood board in Illustrator then design in the browser, that’s my style, y’all...)

## Frameworks, Boilerplates, and Rolling Your Own

90% of the sites I build use Wordpress (because why bother re-inventing the wheel?) but while WP development is undeniably one of my specialties, it’s not appropriate for every project. My portfolio site, for instance, is nothing but good ol’fashioned hand-coded markup, and this blog you’re reading is built using Jekyll, because I prefer writing content in plain-text Markdown than in a CMS’s GUI.

## Side Projects

When I’m not building websites I like to keep myself busy with a plethora of side-projects, of which the mother of all is my music blog. From its humble beginnings back in ’08, the blog has seen me grow from web-N00b to power-user, and has been the unwitting testing ground for what wasn’t necessarily the smoothest of learning curves...

# Day Two

## The Ambient Kettle Project

Andy Stanford-Clark, from IBM, kicked-off day two by introducing us to the *Hy Pi Zero*. The original *Hy Pi* had debuted at ThingMonk 2014 and was a Raspberry Pi powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The *Hy Pi Zero* was the same concept, only this time using the newly-released *Raspberry Pi Zero*. It had taken the team at Arcola all the preceding day to get it up-and-running, and was now powering the slide-deck for the presentation.

He then handed us over to his colleague, Laura Cowen, who talked us through the "Ambient Kettle" she and Andy had been working on.

* It had started when Laura made her kettle post to a custom twitter account every time she made a cup of tea.
* Her mum then started following the kettle's account, and Laura tried to think of ways to streamline the "ambient intimacy" her and her mum were experiencing.
* By abstracting the fundamental characteristics of the experience, Laura and Andy then experimented putting those elements together independently of the act of making a cup of tea itself.
* They identified many UX facets: the sound of the water boiling and the click of the kettle, the shape and feel of the physical object, the colour of the kettle's indicator lights as it boiled, the fact that the experience needed no configuration at all.
* Iterating over various prototypes, they built a pseudo-kettle that severed as a remote indicator that someone (presumably someone you care about) has just made a cup of tea.
* The end result was a tiny dolls-house scale 3D-printed kettle with an LED and speaker.

## The Convergence of IoT and Energy

The real show-stopper talk of the conference was given by Tom Raftery, an analyst at GreenMonk (the environment-focused arm of RedMonk; the event organisers).

* Energy networks are built around spikes and "peak load" (*Bake Off* finishes, and everyone up and down the country puts the kettle on and flushes the loo).
* **2°C** = cap for global warming set by 2009 Copenhagen Climate Accord.
* **565GtCO<sub>2</sub>** = Gigatons of CO<sub>2</sub> needed to reach a 2°C increase (a carbon budget that leaves us with 20-30 years at current emissions rates).
* **2795GtCO<sub>2</sub>** = Proven reserves.

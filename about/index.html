  <h2>I build websites for money and write about music for free.</h2>

  <p>I work as a web-designer/developer at <a href="http://tombuildswebsites.com">Tom Builds Websites</a>. I'm definitely a front-end specialist, but while I wouldn’t risk insulting my hard-core-programmer friends by calling myself a “full stack” developer, I <em>do</em> know enough to shepherd a website all the way from inception to deployment. I’m not just a do-it-in-Photoshop-and-hand-it-off-to-a-developer ‘designer,’ if you get my meaning. (In fact, I hardly ever use Photoshop. Throw down a mood-board in Illustrator then design in the browser, that’s my preferred workflow.)</p>

  <h2>Frameworks, Boilerplates, and Rolling Your Own</h2>

  <p>90% of the sites I build use Wordpress (because why bother re-inventing the wheel?) but while WP development is undeniably one of my specialties, it’s not appropriate for every project. My portfolio site, for instance, is nothing but good ol’fashioned hand-coded markup, and this blog you’re reading is built using Jekyll, because I prefer writing content in plain-text Markdown than in a CMS’s GUI.</p>

  <h2>Side Projects</h2>

  <p>When I’m not building websites I like to keep myself busy with a plethora of side-projects, of which the mother of all is my <a href="http://eatenbymonsters.com">music blog</a>. From its humble beginnings back in ’08, the blog has seen me grow from web-N00b to power-user, and has been the unwitting testing ground for a lot of my early experimentation&hellip;</p>

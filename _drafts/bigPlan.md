## Goal

By 2020 general election, completely change the way news is consumed on the web.

Sophisticated, interactive visualisations of data, and insightful analysis.
Focus on politics and business: make people better informed at the ballot box and the board room.

## Phase 1

Relaunch Eaten by Monsters music blog.

* strong editorial design
* easily browse-able archive
* information in context
    - up: wider, broader context. Position in the world. Big themes, grand ideas, much wow.
    - down: tighter, more focused context. More detail, more specific.
* Reading experience comes before all else

##Â Phase 2

Visually impressive Rugby World Cup infographics website.

* working with complex data-sets
* simple illustrations of complex ideas
* show relationships others have missed
* generate awareness
    - rugby fans on twitter
    - friends and relations
    - tech nerds
    - design geeks
* prove hypothesis : the web can present data and news in a way no other medium can manage

## Phase 3

Upward trajectory.

### Potential "exits" from plan:

* Aqui-hire?
* Traditional hire?
* Investment:
    - runway
    - business model
    - build team
    - real journalism

### Otherwise:

* Expand coverage for 6 Nations
* Alternative deadines:
    - Rio Olympics
    - Wimbledon
    - Ashes (Wisden data-set integration/partnership)

## Phase 4

Expand into other fields
    - business
    - politics

Potential at this point to partner/get-hired-by old-media institution looking to adapt and survive.
* local news
* national, even?

## Phase 5

National/international news brand. Trusted source; part of the collective discussion. Victory.

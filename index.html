    <h1>I'm a web designer and developer based in Cornwall, UK.</h1>
    <h3 class="big-drop-cap">I believe in building websites that are accessible. All devices, platforms, and users should get the same content and the same functionality.</h3>
    <p>I also believe in aesthetics; simplicity of form and function is valuable and important, but simple doesn't have to mean ugly. Careful use of typography, photography, and illustration <em>(ography?)</em> can produce beautiful designs that are as easy and intuitive to use as they are visually pleasing. User Experience and graphic style go hand-in-hand.</p>

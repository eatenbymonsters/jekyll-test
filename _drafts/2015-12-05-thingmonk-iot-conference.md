excerptlong: Some of the leading figures in the IoT industry got together to talk shop. Here's what I thought of it all.

excerptmini: My thoughts on the IoT conference.

excerpt: "ThinkMonk was wall-to-wall interesting and inspiring. I took lots of notes, but naturally focused on the areas that interested me most, and was often too busy trying to take it all in to write anything down..."

ThingMonk styles itself as a conference “for developers, designers, data wranglers and decision-makers that want to turn ideas and concepts into industrial scale systems”.

I was there with my web-developer hat on, but was keeping my eyes peeled for hints at the future of business-tech in general. I'm already deeply embedded in data-visualisation and dynamic analytics, but eager to connect my digital skills to a hardware framework.

## Bullet-Proof & Profitable Things

Ubuntu guru and part-time space tourist [Mark Shuttleworth](http://canonical.com/) made for a high-profile, big-picture opening speaker. It was interesting to hear that his idea of "scale" was not massive super-computers costing exorbitant amounts of money, but rather lots and lots of cheap, tiny micro-computers all working in unison over a network.

* It takes five to ten years to make an overnight success, and *now* is the time to be getting deep into IoT. Wait 12 months and the train will have left the station.
* Real disruption comes from riding a wave of change, and the disaggregation and componentisation we're seeing in the IoT sphere at the moment will inevitably lead to the "hockey stick" graph of innovation.
* Data can be a liability - you must have a responsible security strategy when handling lots of data. One mistake or hack can cripple a big-data company.
* The next version of Ubuntu will be highly modular. Apps will be isolated and contained, and will each have a predefined area they can write to. This allows for robust version control across the system, and no more fear when updating the OS.
* The “Internet of Toys” is going to be more influential than people realise. It's easier to innovate with things that won't kill people. Long-term projects will have to use standards already set by short-term projects.

## Coherent UX for Distributed Systems

User-experience expert [Claire Rowland](http://www.designingconnectedproducts.com/) had some fascinating insights into the challenges of managing UX in a world of connected "things".

* We don't expect "things" to behave like the internet. Light bulbs shouldn't "buffer".
* Interfaces (if they are honest) should introduce the concept of failure to users. Don't fake success when a user clicks a button in a low-connectivity area: show in interstitial "loading" state wherever possible.
* You often have to choose between fuzzy-and-current or accurate-but-old. A cat-tracker can either say "Mrs. Tibbles was at this exact location 3 hours ago" or "Mrs. Tibbles is someehere within this range right now".
* Linking physical and digital interfaces takes special thought. A traditional dimmer-switch always knows it's ‘state’, where as a remotely-controlled version has to account for the fact that the ‘state’ of the bulb might have changed since it last checked.

## From 2 to 2 billion: How to Design for Scale.

Sam Winslet & Sophie Riches from IBM presented us with the "Seven Deadly Sins for Design of IoT":

* Greed: designing for yourself.
* Envy: being a copycat.
* Glutony: focusing on features & functions.
* Wrath: assuming your users know what IoT is.
* Lust: IoT for the sake of it, without any real ideas.
* Pride: don't over-complicate and don't over-simplify. IBM use a strategy they call “Progressive Disclosure”: where an interface reveals deeper levels of detail as a user interacts with it.
* Sloth: assuming users have ∞ patience or care about you/your product.

## Hacking NFC

Nick Ludlum from [Moo](http://moo.com/) gave (with a little help from colleague Kai Turner) one of the more engaging and tech-focused presentations of the event. The team at Moo have (after considerable time spent in R&D) figured out how to print NFC chips into business cards.

* For NFC to work, you need a chip and an antenna. The chip is tiny – literally mm across – and the antenna gets printed between to laminated sheets of paper using conductive silver ink. This means the finished business card looks and feels just like a regular card - after all, it's still mostly just card and ink.
* To build a reader, all you need is a "smarter" chip, an antenna, and a power source. Android phones have the ability to be NFC readers, but IOS ones do not.

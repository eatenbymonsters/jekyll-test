### The quest for elegant productivity hacks is both fantastically useful and fantastically counter-productive. If you want, you can waste days reading about how not to waste your time.

In some ways it amazes me that the simple concept of “being productive” has sprung up an entire community – an entire industry, even – but like it or not there are countless books and blogs on *Getting Things Done* (or GTD, as the <strike>cool</strike> [corporate](http://www.davidco.com/about-gtd) kids call it). As someone who will happily obsess over the finest minutiae of something for ages before actually *doing* anything, this brand of procrastinating about avoiding procrastination really hits me where I live.

Lately, though, it seems that all the hours I've spent reading about productivity-hacks weren't wasted after all; my current system finds me being *more* efficient and productive than I've ever been before. And at the hub of my new-found momentum lies my Bullet Journal. Devised by the inspired Brooklynite [Ryder Carrol](http://www.rydercarroll.com/), the [Bullet Journal](http://www.bulletjournal.com/) is little more than a seemingly-simple method of writing out a ‘to-do’ list using a pen and a notebook.

## I don't think the journal is *solely* responsible for my productivity upswing.

By way of a disclaimer, making the switch to a Bullet Journal workflow wasn't the only change I've made recently. A few months ago I quit my day-job and struck out on my own; an intrepid freelancer *cum* entrepreneur bound for riches and glory! So now that any-and-all money that I make is directly proportional to how much work I do, it'll come as no surprise that I'm working harder and longer than ever before (and would be with or without the Bullet Journal).

## But it *is* a revelation, and not quite as simple as it sounds.

I've been writing to-do lists for years but while they'd often prove useful for a short while, they tended to fade into irrelevance as time passed. What first drew me to the Bullet Journal was the systematized nature of its bullet-point organization, but what's *kept* me using it is the way it stays relevant.

The system itself is fairly simple – each list item is marked with either a square, circle or mid-dot. The square boxes denote tasks, circles events, and dots are standard notes (things to remember, but not explicitly actionable). I've experimented with similar list-hierarchies in the past, with mixed results, and while this new one is elegant, it's not exactly revolutionary. What I've found to be a revelation is the way the Bullet Journal rolls-over from day-to-day and month-to-month.

At the start of every day I write out a new daily list. Any items unchecked from the day before are either struck-through (which denotes they've become irrelevant) or marked with an arrow and copied into the new daily list. This means that there's only ever one ‘active’ list,

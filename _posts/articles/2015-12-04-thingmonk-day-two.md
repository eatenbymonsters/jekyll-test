# Day Two

## The Ambient Kettle Project

Andy Stanford-Clark, from IBM, kicked-off day two by introducing us to the *Hy Pi Zero*. The original *Hy Pi* had debuted at ThingMonk 2014 and was a Raspberry Pi powered by a hydrogen fuel cell. The *Hy Pi Zero* was the same concept, only this time using the newly-released *Raspberry Pi Zero*. It had taken the team at Arcola all the preceding day to get it up-and-running, and was now powering the slide-deck for the presentation.

He then handed us over to his colleague, Laura Cowen, who talked us through the "Ambient Kettle" she and Andy had been working on.

A recent [episode of the Boagworld podcast](http://boagworld.com/season/10/episode/1007/) saw Marcus and Paul listing the ten ‘web people’ they've found most *inspiring*, which has in turn inspired me to publish my own list.

[The]() web-creators community is packed with generous people willing to share their insights and experiences. Through blog posts and podcasts, conference talks and tutorials, these people have had a direct impact on my outlook and my career choices.

## 01: [Steven Lovegrove](http://stevenlovegrove.com/)

He's long since left the web behind to do ‘real’ science, but having a patient friend like Steve (who was willing to let me spend hours peering over his shoulder while he coded) was probably the single biggest factor in shaping the direction my career has taken.

## 02, 03: [Chris Coyier](http://twitter.com/chriscoyier) and [Dave Rupert](http://twitter.com/davatron5000)

Anyone who's ever Googled a CCS question has probably benefited from Chris' sterling work on his website *[CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/)*, but it's his video tutorials (on Lynda.com and the “Lodge” section of his own website) that have impacted my world the most.

His approach of *getting-it-wrong-on-camera-and-then-fixing-it(-probably)* was a welcome break from other more sanitised tutorials. In real life, not everything installs perfectly the first time and sometimes closing tags are overlooked. Seeing how professionals deal with these problems is almost as useful as the main tutorials themselves.

Chris also does sterling work in the podcast field with his partner in crime Dave Rupert, and if you're not entertained by the combination of in-depth Q-and-A, stupid sound effects, and friendly banter that they put out in the *[Shop Talk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/)*, then you're probably not interested in front-end development.

As an added bonus, their mantra is probably the single most useful bit of advice any web professional can give:

> Just. Build. Websites.

## 04: [Brad Frost](http://twitter.com/brad_frost)

I'm never more aware of (or excited by) the unique nature of designing for the web than when I listen to Brad Frost. If every colleague and every client could take the time to [read his blog](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/) and [watch his talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE0CRMm59BY), the standard of our work and the quality of our work-lives would raise ten-fold across the board.

The idea of designing ‘paintings of websites’ (a.k.a. PSD mockups) is completely outdated; we can't just design for one ideal viewport size, or two, or ten, or a hundred. “Atomic Design” might sound like a buzz word, but the principles are universally applicable to web work and the basic concept of designing components first and pages last is quite simply How It Should Be Done Now.

I love to hear people talking candidly and in-depth about fields they are experts in. It almost doesn't matter what the topic is (which is one of the reasons I love Radio 4's *In Our Time* so much), but when the topic is illustration I love it even more. *[Adventures In Design](http://www.aidpodcast.com/)* is invariably the most irreverent and unhinged podcast you're likely to hear, but equally it's always the most honest and informative, too.

They always have good guests, but more importantly host Mark, with help from Billy and James, knows just how to get the most interesting and inspirational discussion from them. The resulting discussions are often challenging, often controversial, and always riveting listening.

The AID team aren't ashamed of making a living: this is a podcast about the **business** of design. It just so happens that the design field they work in is the super-cool one of gig posters and illustration.

Anyone can make it work

I know a couple of the people on this list IRL, and a couple more I'd class as ‘digital acquaintances’, but most are just web personalities who's work, public speaking, or blogging has taught me something new, steered me when my course has wandered, opened my eyes to new ways of thinking, or just been inspiring in some more ineffable manner.

People like this are what makes the web such a fantastic industry to be a part of, and I owe them all a debt of gratitude.

intro: Designing for the web is about more than painting pretty pictures of websites. You have to get down and dirty in the browser as soon as possible.

In this post-smartphone age we have to build sites that work on everything from watch-sized screens to touch devices the size of table-tops. The print ‘canvas’ is a myth in web-design; as designers we must embrace the dynamic ever-changing beauty of the web.

So how do we do it? By experimenting, by testing, by iterating. No one ever created a beautifully elegant checkout submission process by using static images, and no one did it in one abstract brainstorming session.

I'm a UX designer and developer at [DWM](//wearedwm.com), where I currently spend most of my time re-designing client-onboarding processes and obsessing about whether or not to get a Standing Desk (for the crazy-start-up kudos).

Browse my [portfolio](/portfolio) to see some (not so recent) examples of my work, and read more of my thoughts on designing for the web on my [blog](/blog). Say hi (and tell me how wrong you think I am, maybe?) by emailing me at [tom@tomhazledine.com](mailto:tom@tomhazledine.com) or catch me on Twitter as [@thomashazledine](//twitter.com/thomashazledine); I'm always happy to answer any questions or engage in spirited debate.

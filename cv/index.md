{:.intro#intro}
I am a front-end developer and UX/UI designer, currently working for the DWM agency in Newquay, Cornwall. 

Frustrated with being seen as merely a "contractor", I feel the time has come to switch to more product-led workflow.

I'm becoming increasingly excited by the idea of iterative problem solving and marginal improvements. I hear about the exiting work coming out of organizations like GDS and The Guardian, and want some of that action for myself here in Cornwall.

There ares only *so* many side-projects I can fit into evenings and weekends, and I want to experience that same sense of fulfillment in my day job too.

> I try to build things that are "of the web" not just "on the web".

{:#skills}
## Current Responsibilities and Interests

### 1. Front-end Templating

Currently responsible for designing and building all visual "interactions" for client sites. Regularly work within a given styleguide or static design from an external "visual" designer (which comes with it's own *special* set of issues).

I use pure CSS wherever possible, but frequently use plenty of Javascript. Regularly use third-party libraries and plugins, but not always. I try to be judicial with my inclusion of jQuery: if a couple of extra lines of vanilla JS can replace an entire library, that's what I'll aim for.

Recent projects have included:

* "View" development for MVC projects (several projects built in Laravel, but lately I've been using Vue.js for front-end data binding etc.).
* Interaction with JSON APIs (most recently the Wordpress REST API).
* Animations and iconsets: mobile menus, scrollers and sliders, etc.
* Custom CSS for form elements: datepickers, selects and checkboxes.
* Automated workflow: always use Gulp.js as a task-runner, and employ GIT-based deployment for more complex projects.

### 2. Performance

Having been lumbered with legacy code and poorly-spec'd projects far too often, I'm now a firm believer in performance budgets and baking-in speed considerations from the very beginning of a project.

My current personal site [tomhazledine.com](http://tomhazledine.com/) rates at 97/100 on Google's PageSpeed Insights tester (at time of writing).

* Static-site generator Jekyll is used for templating. It compiles complex HTML-includes and -partials into static files.
* Inline "critical path" CSS in the first 14.5kb of the site.
* Asynchronous loading of assets: both javascript *and* main css.
* Concatenation and minification of all scripts and resources. All JS libs/plugins and SCSS partials reduced to just two HTTP requests.
* Inline SVG icon set.
* The final steps to get the last 3%? Minify HTML and leverage browser caching on external fonts (which is out of my control as long as I keep using Typekit to serve my fonts).

### 3. HTML Audio

With a background in music and audio technology, I've always been interested in the delivery of audio on the web. My most recent side project is [SFAP.js](http://tomhazledine.com/audioDemo/), an open-source tool for styling audio players with CSS.

I've also experimented with the Web Audio API to build a fully-functioning synthesizer using HTML, CSS and javascript: [tomhazledine.com/keyboard](http://tomhazledine.com/keyboard/).

### 4. CSS Illustration

I like making CSS Illustrations. Partly to keep my CSS skills honed, but mostly for fun. My CSS Cassette, Pong-style loader, and Bear have all been featured on the front-page of [CodePen](http://codepen.io/tomhazledine/).

### 5. Typography, Type Design, and Lettering

Type design is long-time hobby of mine. I've yet to make a decent typeface all of my own, but my experiments have given me a fantastic insight into the world of typography and typesetting.

A few years ago I bought and restored an old hand-cranked letterpress machine. Setting type by hand has given me an intimate physical understanding of design concepts like 'measure' and 'leading' and 'ems' and 'ens'.

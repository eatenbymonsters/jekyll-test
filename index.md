intro: The “Internet of Things” is my current area of interest, with a particular focus on visualising all the data these “things” are generating. Data without context in not information.

To get real insight from our data it must be presented in a useful way. I'm a web-specialist at heart, and I believe that web-technologies make the best interfaces for our IoT projects. If you also think the web (and the burgeoning IoT industry) is a force for good, follow me on Twitter [@thomashazledine](//twitter.com/thomashazledine), or if 140 characters isn't enough you can always reach me by email at [tom@tomhazledine.com](mailto:tom@tomhazledine.com).

When I'm not tinkering with sensors and Raspberry Pis or making websites, I muck about with [CSS illustration](http://codepen.io/tomhazledine/pen/IwEDu) and build interfaces for the web audio API, including a [fully-functional synthesizer built using JS, HTML and CSS](http://tomhazledine.com/keyboard/).
